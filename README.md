To test this out locally, you can run the following command from the terminal:
```python3 -m http.server```

This runs a basic "web server" in the local directory you run the command in, which for this should be `~/src/memory/`

And then you can test it in a browser by going to http://localhost:8000/

in the same terminal, type control-C to kill the web server
